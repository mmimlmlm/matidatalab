👋 Hi, I’m @mmimlmlm

👀 I’m interested in data science, AI applications, and solving real-world problems through technology.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced data visualization techniques and machine learning algorithms.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to data analysis or AI-driven tools.

📫 How to reach me: Feel free to connect with me via GitHub or email at matiaslagunasl@outlook.com.

😄 Pronouns: He/Him (Él).

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy exploring the hidden patterns in data as much as discovering new places through maps and technology.
